<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p class="text-justify"> Elections are the cornerstone of democratic societies and low voter turnout has been a longstanding challenge globally, as it compromises the representative nature of the elected governments. This report will critically analyse the various strategies that have been adopted to increase voter turnout while examining the study ‘Social Pressure and Voter Turnout’ by Gerber, et al. (2008) as a case example. The study inspected the effectiveness of leveraging social motivation by the means of social pressure mail, neighbourhood peer pressure, and civic duty messaging to uplift voter engagement. This report will assess the methodology, results, and limitations of the study, evaluating the alignment of its discoveries with established theories of voter motivation and behavioural prediction models.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Behaviour change interventions are a coordinated set of tasks, framed to influence specified behavioural patterns (Michie, et al., 2011). This report will be centralised on these interventions, which can be implemented in the context of voter turnout by executing relevant strategies and motivating voters to take part in elections. As the voter behaviour is influenced by numerous interconnected factors, the report will use the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework by Michie, et al. (2014) to design and propose an alternative approach for behaviour change. The BCW provides a systematic and exhaustive way to understand the target behaviour, to identify the causes of behaviour change, and to select fitting intervention functions and strategies (D’Lima, et al., 2020). The report will also examine the potential consequences and ethical considerations of the discussed interventions, for the existing study as well as for the suggested approach, to increase voter turnout.</p>

<h5>Target Behaviour</h5>
<p class="text-justify"> The elemental behaviour targeted in this study is increasing the participation of voters in democratic elections. Voter turnout is a key metric that bespeaks the democratic health and legitimacy of a region (Sing, 2011). It is the percentage of the voting-eligible population that actually cast a ballot during an election. Constantly declining or low voting percentage is a significant issue, as the representatives and policies elected by a small portion of the adult population can fail to comprehensively mirror the diverse values, interests, and priorities of the wider electorate (Lachat, 2011).</p>
<p class="text-justify"> The global trend of declining participation and increase in apathy towards electoral processes necessitates a behaviour change intervention to boost voter turnout. Multiple interconnected factors contribute to this issue including lack of knowledge about the voting procedures, deteriorating belief in the importance of voting, perceived barriers to accessing polling stations, and the general social attitude that considers voting as an inconsequential act (Kelley & Mirer, 1974).</p>
<p class="text-justify"> By strategically targeting the voting behaviour of voting-eligible citizens, a reasonably framed intervention can help in improving the functioning of electoral systems, ensuring significant representation of diverse perspectives, and fostering a civically more engaged community. This will be achieved by analysing the multifaceted factors of voter behaviour and applying the strategies of evidence-based behaviour change.</p>

<br>

<br>
<h5> Influence Techniques</h5>
<p class="text-justify"> The study by Gerber, et al. (2008) essentially employed four influence techniques and a combination of them to influence voter behaviour. These included civic duty messaging, social pressure mail, household source intervention, and neighbourhood norm treatment. </p>
<p class="text-justify"> Social pressure treatment was utilised as the fundamental strategy in which the voters were mailed a message notifying that their voting records will be shared publicly with their neighbours after the election. This strategy supposed that people would be compelled to vote to avoid being judged by their fellow community members, hence leveraging the principles of public accountability and social validation. From a theoretical standpoint, the social pressure tactic is based on the concept of injunctive social norms, i.e., the perception of what others approve or disapprove of (Fieldhouse & Cutts, 2021). By inferring voter participation as a socially approved and expected behaviour, and by notifying that non-participation will be publicised, the strategy aimed to influence the behaviour of voters using social motivation.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Civic duty message underscored the importance of voting in a democracy and aimed to strengthen the individuals’ sense of civic responsibility. The principle of this strategy aligned with the concept of ‘voter duty’ (Blais, 2000), which posits that impacting the election outcome is not the only motivation for people to vote. It states that moral obligation and civic virtue are also a major influence on voter behaviour. Theoretically, this tactic leveraged effective communication methods to shape individuals’ attitudes and beliefs about voting, eventually to enrich the perceived value and importance of exercising their voting rights.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> In household source intervention, voters were simply informed about their household’s voter turnout from the previous elections. This was based on the simple nudging theory that reminding people of the upcoming election and providing them with a personalised statistic will subtly influence them to cast their vote. Whereas in neighbourhood norm treatment, the voters were informed about the recent voting percentage of their neighbourhood. This was theoretically based on descriptive social norm, i.e., the perception of what others are doing, and the human tendency to conform to the perceived norms (Gerber & Rogers, 2009).</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Although, by just focusing on appealing to the voters through different messaging strategies, the study overlooked the multifaceted and complex nature of voter behaviour. Interrelated psychological factors such as motivations, attitudes, and perceived barriers, can shape voter behaviour over just public accountability. Therefore, a more exhaustive, multi-component intervention strategy is needed to influence voter behaviour effectively.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework provides a structured and evidence-based methodology for crafting behaviour change interventions (Atkins & Michie, 2015). The interventions designed using BCW can analyse the complex interplay of the capability, opportunity, and motivation factors influencing the target behaviour. To apply the BCW to increase voter turnout, a thorough analysis of the voting behaviour would be conducted. Also, barriers and facilitators of voting will be identified across the domains of psychological and physical capability, social and physical opportunity, and reflective and automatic motivation.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Depending on the analysis, appropriate intervention functions would be selected from the BCW framework. For instance, psychological capability, i.e., knowledge and skills about the voting processes, could be enhanced using education and training interventions, while physical opportunity, i.e., increasing accessibility of polling stations, could be improved using environmental restructuring. Additionally, social opportunity and automatic motivation could be leveraged by persuasion and modelling interventions, using trusted messengers, role models, and social norms. Reflective motivation could be enhanced by incentivisation and enablement interventions by appealing to intrinsic values and extrinsic rewards tied to civic engagement. This could include small financial incentives, merchandise discounts, or even tax credits and rebates to voters as a positive inducement for exercising their voting rights. However, these incentives must be designed with caution to avoid any concern of coercion or undue influence. </p>
<p class="text-justify"> Following this, relevant behaviour change techniques and modes of delivery would be identified with the chosen intervention functions. For example, mass media campaigns, digital platforms, or community outreach could be used for persuasive messaging, which can leverage principles like authority, social proof, and emotional appeals. Finally, the selected techniques and strategies would be combined collectively based on the identified barriers and facilitators, and specific to the context and target electorate, to formulate a comprehensive multi-component intervention.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> The holistic approach of BCW, and its priority to understand the factors of the target behaviour across multiple domains, makes it befitting for developing interventions that can address the complex and multi-faceted nature of voter behaviour (Müller, 2018). Therefore, a BCW-based intervention would provide more sustainable, substantial, and ethically sound results by selecting and integrating relevant interventions effectively, compared to the limited scope of the social pressure and civic duty message implemented by the study.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> The BCW provides a robust framework for creating effective behaviour change interventions, describing the theoretical basis and its insightful application. It fosters systematic selection of intervention functions, behaviour change techniques, and their modes of delivery, tailored uniquely to each context and the target population (Ogden, 2016). The interventions aimed at increasing voter turnout can constructively address the diverse set of social, psychological, and regional factors influencing the voter participation by adapting this comprehensive approach.</p>

<br>
<h5> Evaluation of the Interventions</h5>
<p class="text-justify"> To evaluate the effectiveness of the Gerber, et al. (2008) study’s interventions, a large-scale experiment was set up during the 2006 primary election cycle in the USA at the state and local levels, thus, not limiting the analysis to one single election event. Multiple treatment groups were created to test the different strategies, along with a control group that received no intervention. A quantitative metric was used to evaluate the effect of the used tactics on voter turnout across the different groups. By contrasting the voting percentage of each treatment group against the control group, the researchers were able to quantify the effect of their interventions on the voting percentage. The civic duty message group observed a 1.8 percentage higher voting turnout than the control group, while the treatment group subjected to a combination of civic duty and neighbourhood norm interventions witnessed an increase of 4.8 voting percentage. The group that underwent the household source intervention saw a 4.9 percentage higher voting than the control group. The group subjected to social pressure intervention observed the strongest effect with an increase of 8.1 percentage in the turnout.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> The field experiment of the research did show a statistically significant growth in voter turnout, but its effect size was modest. This indicates that the practical impact of the intervention was relatively small, specifically when the costs, efforts, and ethical concerns of implementing the tactic on such a broader scale are considered. Besides, the publishing of personal data of individuals and localities raised ethical concerns about potential data privacy violations. The most effective intervention of the study, the social pressure message of notifying the voters to publicise their voting records, was perceived as voter shaming (Green & Gerber, 2020). Furthermore, the study did not consider the various psychological factors that can influence the voters. The study did not analyse the sustainability of its strategy in a long run, or the potential habituation of voters to the messaging interventions used. Also, it did not consider the potential reactance that voters may rebel to the coercive tactic of creating social pressure and might intentionally decrease their participation further.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Therefore, the proposed BCW framework was proposed to address these limitations and to design more exhaustive interventions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions designed using BCW, a thorough evaluation plan must be implemented. As a first step, the desired outcome of the interventions will be clearly defined, such as increasing the voting percentage. Quantitative factors like voter turnout rate, as well as qualitative factors like knowledge of voters, their attitude towards the democratic processes and social norms, will be identified as outcome measures. Randomised controlled trial or a quasi-experimental study can be selected for the evaluation. Data collection methods like interviews and surveys would be used to gather the needed information from the target population before, during, and after the application of interventions. To compare the effect of the interventions on the different treatment groups with the control group, and to assess the significance of the changes in the outcomes, statistical analysis could be conducted.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Apart from analysing the outcomes, evaluation of the process would be essential to understand the reach, quality, and acceptability of the BCW oriented interventions (Hulscher, et al., 2003). This could be done by collecting feedback from voters, the election officials, and other stakeholders such as the candidates. Spreading out surveys, creation of focus groups, or critical observation of behaviour could be used as a process to collect feedback. The findings can then be circulated to support future efforts of voter mobilisation, frame new interventions, and to provide evidence for the use of BCW framework in influencing voter behaviour. Adequate ethical consideration, cultural relevance, and holistic involvement of stakeholders would be essential for the evaluation.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> Despite being a valuable framework, the BCW has limitations of its own. While the comprehensiveness of BCW is an asset, it may pose challenges in its practical application, as extensive knowledge of the framework will be needed to navigate effectively (Michie, et al., 2011). The multiple layers and components of the model often requires profound training and expertise to work with it. Even though BCW acknowledges the effect of social and environmental factors, it emphasises on individual level behaviour change. The approach may overlook the structural and systematic factors such as public policies, cultural norms, and socio-economic conditions, which can be crucial in influencing voter behaviour. Also, the reliance of the model on a rational decision-making model may not capture the complex human behaviour completely and might get influenced by emotions and biases. Furthermore, the BCW framework was originally designed in western contexts, and might not adequately incorporate some cultural factors, that can influence behaviour in few settings. Despite the criticism, the BCW remains a relevant and valuable framework for shaping voter behaviour.</p>

<br>
<h5>Ethical Considerations</h5>
<p class="text-justify"> The attempt to influence voter behaviour must be considered cautiously as it can raise several ethical concerns. The Social Pressure study was severely criticised for threatening the public about sharing their voting records publicly. Its key intervention, social pressure message, was perceived as a coercive tactic and its implementation was considered as an attempt of social shaming and invasion of privacy (Panagopoulos, 2010). Further, the was never made clear to the voters if the researchers actually intended to publicise their personal data or even if they truly had the authority to do so, which was a form of deceptive messaging.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> It is important that interventions prioritise informed decision making and avoid coercion or manipulation. An ideal intervention aimed at increasing voter turnout must inform the citizens about its purpose and methodology, allowing them to opt not to vote without worrying about any consequence. Interventions should aim for neutrality and avoid any form of biased messaging involving a party or candidate, respecting the principle of free and fair elections. Furthermore, interventions must strive for equity and their implementation must not exclude or disadvantage specific demographic groups unfairly, based on their ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status, or political affiliation. Strict data protection regulations must be followed if the intervention involves collection, storage, or sharing of personal data related to voting behaviour. Also, such processes involving the personal data of voters must include informed consent procedures to respect individual privacy rights. Additionally, ongoing evaluation can assist in monitoring the intervention for unintended consequences and potential misuse.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> The BCW based intervention has the ability to be more ethical compared to the strategies used in the discussed study. The proposed intervention focuses on addressing the capability, opportunity, and motivation factors of voting behaviour through education, persuasion, and environmental restructuring. This will ensure that the citizens make an informed choice learning from the process of intervention, but with their own motivation, rather than succumbing to external pressure. However, the intervention design and implementation process must still be evaluated carefully at each stage. For instance, the selection of the behaviour-change strategies and their modes of delivery should be transparent, non-discriminating, respect data privacy and avoid any form of deception or manipulation.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p class="text-justify"> Influencing voter behaviour and increasing their participation in the elections is a complex issue and require a thorough understanding of the entangled factors that drive the human behaviour change. The study by Gerber et. al (2008) provided valuable insights about the potential efficiency of using social norms and public accountability in increasing voter turnout. Although, the modest effect size of the study, having several ethical concerns, its narrow focus on social pressure tactics, and failure to interpret the diverse psychological factors of voter behaviour highlighted its limitations. Thus, there is need of a mixed method approach which combines the quantitative metrics like the voting percentage and cost-effectiveness with qualitative insights about voter behaviour and their underlying mechanisms for creating an effective and comprehensive intervention.</p>
<p class="text-justify"> The Behaviour change wheel provides a valuable methodology for designing more ethical and effective interventions to boost voter turnout. An intervention based on BCW can address the multifaceted factors of voter behaviour by addressing the interconnection of the capability, opportunity, and motivational factors affecting the voter behaviour. Its robust framework fosters the designing, implementation, and evaluation of multi-component interventions, tailed to the target population. It allows the intervention designers to strategically select and implement appropriate intervention functions and behaviour change techniques. This will be based on the in-depth analysis of barriers and enablers of the desired voting behaviour. </p>
<p class="text-justify"> Although, it is crucial that such interventions prioritise ethical principles of autonomy, equity, transparency, and non-coercion. While staying focused on the broader social goal of promoting civic engagement, the interventions must empower the citizens with knowledge and resources, appealing to their natural motivation to vote, but still providing them the free space to choose not to vote without fear. </p>
<p class="text-justify"> Increasing voter turnout is a long-term commitment to creating a culture of voter participation and promoting the legitimacy of democratic processes. Also, it demands a deep appreciation for the various democratic agencies, that must make an individual feel encouraged and motivated enough to exercise their voting rights. Conclusively, integrating proven strategies with an abiding respect of democratic ideals, as well as human dignity, is the key to ignite widespread civic engagement.</p>
